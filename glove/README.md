# GLOVE directory

To use the GloVe embeddings, download the embeddings from the GloVe website: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. The embeddings used in this project are the 100-dimensional embeddings trained on the 6B token corpus.

This directory contains the GloVe embeddings. The embeddings are stored in a text file with the following format:
```
word1 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4
word2 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5
...
```
The first column is the word, and the rest of the columns are the embedding values.
